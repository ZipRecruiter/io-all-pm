IO::All Rewrite Design Document
===============================

This document discusses all of the things that the rewrite will strive to accomplish.

== High Level Goals

* Backwards compatible (except on highly broken behaviors).
* Sexy API
* Pluggable
* Object Oriented
* Sane Defaults
* Exceptions
* Target 5.8.1+
* Unicode aware
* Eye on Acmeism

== Backwards Compatibility

We want the new IO::All to not cause any damage out of the box. We will form
good deprecation strategies for things in the grey areas.

For the first releases we can make the simple usage:

  use IO::All;

do almost all the old behavior, including overloading. We can put bad defaults
on a deprecation diet.

Most new usages will include at least one option:

  use IO::All -something;

Any option usage will indicate new usage, so we can use the preferred defaults.

== Sexy API

Sexy is the main attraction to IO::All. Don't ruin what is already great. Make
it more clean and consistent.

The `io` constructor stays, but it becomes composed in deterministic ways.
Simple things simpleâ€¦ production ready things possible.

IO::All is locally configurable. Options are specified on the `use` statement:

  use IO::All -local, -with => qw(::HTTP ::Socket), -utf8;

Options may include:

`-legacy` :: Use old school defaults
`-with => qw(<plugin list>)` :: List the plugin modules that will be used.
`-utf8` :: Encode/Decode using UTF8
`-encoding` => <encoding>` :: Specify encoding
`-strict` :: Extra strict error checking
`-local` :: Block level scoping

== Pluggable

All of the actual IO operations/methods will happen in plugins. Plugins will
have an API that lets them hook into the constructor heuristics and expose a
chainable constructor method of their own.

Maybe something like this:

  package IO::All::Foo;
  use constant heuristic => qr{^foo://};
  use constant constructor => 'foo';

== Object Oriented

This is always a difficult choice in Perl5. I don't plan to use any OO
framework, and I don't plan to use accessor methods (unless they are part of
the external facing API). However I do want to have something like roles, so
we'll have to think about that. (::File and ::Dir both need a role called
::Filesys).

The old IO::All uses a blessed glob so that we can use the object as a
filehandle. This is of dubious importance, and we'd be better off with a hash
based object. We can still get the handle with something like:

  say $io->handle "O HAI";

IO::All will keep its chainable setters, but will also support immutable
creation of objects that seem to be all the rage with the MOP crowd. Need to
figure out that API detail.

All plugins will be subclassable. IO::All itself will be subclassable (not sure
on this one). I'd like to provide a Role class that can be used when other
modules want IO::All behavior API.

== Sane Defaults

* Overloading off by default.
* Only ::File/::Dir plugins on by default.
* Strict error checking on by default.

== Exceptions

We'll throw exceptions early and often. Exceptions will be the only way that
failure is reported.

== Target 5.8.1

Target the toolchain recognized oldest Perl (currently 5.8.1).

== Unicode

Make unicode just work as simply and consistent as possible.

== Acmeism

I want to make IO::All be easily portable to other languages. I think it will
be the best way to do I/O in lots of languages.
